## Overview 

The Bambu Conveyor is an application designed to manage the waste output of a [Bambu Labs printer](https://bambulab.com/en/x1). It utilizes the MQTT protocol to monitor the printer's status and control a motor that moves waste material away from the printing area. Supports X1, currently testing A1 and P1 compatibility. See settings menu.

# Bambu Poop Conveyor - Setup & Installation Guide  

## Setup  

## Flashing the ESP32

To install the firmware, use one of the following methods:

### **Method 1: Web Installer (Easiest Method)**
- Open **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.
- Go to **[Bambu ESP32 Installer](https://t0nyz.com/flasher)**.
- Click the **"Install"** button and follow the on-screen instructions.
---

### **Method 2: Manual Installation**

#### **1. Download and Install ESPTool**  
   - Install `esptool` using pip:  
     ```sh
     pip install esptool
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the precompiled ESPTool from the official Espressif GitHub.

#### **2. Download the Firmware File**  
   - Download the latest firmware from the **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/t0nyz0/Bambu-Poop-Conveyor-ESP32/releases/latest)**.  

#### **3. Connect Your ESP32**  
   - Plug your ESP32 into your computer using a USB cable.  
   - Ensure drivers for the USB-to-serial adapter are installed (CH340, CP210x, etc.).  

#### **4. Find the Serial Port**  
   - On **macOS/Linux**, run:  
     ```sh
     ls /dev/tty.*
     ```  
     Look for something like `/dev/tty.usbserial-1`.  
   - On **Windows**, open **Device Manager** and check under **Ports (COM & LPT)**.  

#### **5. Flash the Firmware**  
   - Replace `<PORT>` with your ESP32â€™s serial port (e.g., `/dev/tty.usbserial-1`):  
     ```sh
     esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/tty.usbserial-1 --baud 460800 write_flash \
       0x0 Bambu-Poop-Conveyor.v1.3.0-final.bin
     ```  

#### **6. Verify Flashing and Restart**  
   - Once flashing completes, restart your ESP32 by unplugging/replugging it or pressing the **EN** or **RST** button.  

Your ESP32 should now be running the updated firmware.

## Configuring via Web Interface

Once flashed, the ESP32 starts in AP Mode:

1. Connect to the **"BambuConveyor"** WiFi network.
2. Open a browser and go to **[192.168.4.1/config](http://192.168.4.1/config)**.
3. Enter your WiFi and MQTT credentials.
4. Click **Save**. The ESP32 will reboot and connect to your WiFi.

For troubleshooting, open an issue on GitHub or check the discussions tab.


## Usage

### Web Server

The application hosts a web server to provide manual control and configuration. Access the following URLs for different functionalities:

- **Root URL:** Opens Configuration page (`/`)
- **Control URL:** Manual motor control page (`/control`)
- **Config URL:** Configuration page to update settings (`/config`) 
- **Logs URL:** Log history page (`/logs`)
- **Manual Run URL:** Opening this URL runs the motor manually (`/run`)

### FAQ / Troubleshooting

*What do the flashing lights mean when its first turned on?*
- Flashing yellow only = Connecting to WiFi
- Solid Green = We are connected to Wifi and MQTT printer
- Red Light on bootup = No Wifi / No MQTT (Solid red also when conveyor is running)
- Green light / Yellow flashing = Wifi connected / Attempting to connect to printer
- Green light / Yellow solid = Wifi conncted / Issue connecting to printer via MQTT / Will reattempt connection after 5 seconds

*The ESP32 doesnt connect to the printer*
- Double check that your printer is setup with Access Code and LAN only mode is **OFF** [See Bambu Wiki](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/knowledge-sharing/enable-lan-mode)
- Double check your SN matches the settings you put in
- Make sure your printer has good Wifi signal
- Make sure the ESP32 has good Wifi signal
- Reach out to me if you still have issues
